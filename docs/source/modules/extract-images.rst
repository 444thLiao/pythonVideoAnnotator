Extract the contour's images
===========================================


This module generates images by extracting them from a contour.

------------------------
How to use
------------------------

| 1. Open the **"Modules"** tab and choose the **"Extract the contour's images"** module.
|
| 2. For each tab, choose the settings accordingly to how you want your images to be extracted:
|


Extract from contours
--------------------------------------

In this tab, **check** the corresponding checkboxes to select the **video**, the **object** and the object's **contour** you want to extract the images from.

Use the **blue slider or the left and right textboxes** to **set a start and an end frame**. The images will only be extracted for the frames in that interval.

.. note :: 

	To change the start and end frame you also have to click on the name of the video, **not just the checkbox**

Mask
--------------------------------------

| In this tab you can apply diferent masks to the image:
| 		- to apply a simple mask check **"Apply a mask to the image"**
|  		-  



Margin, image size and stretch image
--------------------------------------



Rotate images
--------------------------------------


Center images
--------------------------------------


Export images per events
--------------------------------------

| In this tab you can organize the export images by events:
| 		- By checking an event, all the frames during that event will be exported to a folder with the event name.
| 		- All the frames in which no event occurs or no event is selected will be exported to a folder named **"untagged"**.

.. note :: Click the **"Reload events"** button if you don't see any events in the **"Events"** tab

|
| 3. Choose the directory you want to save the generated images in by clicking the **"Open"** button on the bottom right side. A folder with the name of the video will be created in that directory.

.. note:: If you don't choose a directory, then a folder named **"contour-images"** will be created in your current directory.

| 4. Click the **"Apply"** button to generate the images.
|

Result

The result is a folder in the directory you chose with the name of your video. This folder contains all the images generated by the module. Navigate the folder to find the images, as they will be inside subfolders.
