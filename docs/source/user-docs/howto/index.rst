A new window will appear asking for the project folder. You should select the folder and press open.

.. seealso:: Find information about the project folders structure in the :ref:`Project tree <projecttree-label>` section.

Save a project
===============

It is possible to save a project by using the options "Save" or "Save as" in the "File" menu of the main window.

Save
-------------

Update the current project files with the last changes.

.. note:: if you are saving the project for the first time, this option will behaves like the "Save as" option.

Path
`````````````
A path dataset stores information about an object path.

Contours

A contours dataset stores information about the object contours overtime, but it has also information about the object path.

Value
`````````````
This property stores any arbitrary number that change overtime. It can be used to store external data like for example hardware triggers.
